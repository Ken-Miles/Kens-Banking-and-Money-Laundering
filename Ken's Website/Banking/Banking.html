        <h1 class="header">How we do Banking</h1>

        <p class="center"> Our banking services are located offshore, outside of the United States. This is for a multitude of reasons, including:</p>

        <h2 class="subheader">The absence of taxes to the US</h2>
        <p class="center">Because you don't wanna pay taxes, do you?</p>

        <h2 class="subheader">The absence of the need to follow Know Your Customer laws (KYC)</h2>
        <p class="center">Because we don't want to collect any more information than we have to.</p>

        <h2 class="subheader">The ability to do banking privately, without being spied on by the government.</h2>
        <p class="center">Because no goverment should spy on your banking activity.</p>

        <p class="subheader">Because of this, criminals and other fugitives as well as law-abiding citizens are able to use our services without the need for taxes or being spied on.</p>
