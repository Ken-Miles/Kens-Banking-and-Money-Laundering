        <h1 class="header">How we do Money Laundering</h1>
        <p class="subheader">We do only the best of money laundering, which includes 3 stages:</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">Placement</h2>
        <p>We take the questionable money, and then place it into businesses or other hobbies or the like with legitmate income. This usually includes cash intensive bueinesses, such as a car wash, nightclub, casino, gentlemans club, etc. This depends on the amount paid up front and the amount of questionable income. We do not do this if the amount is too small, or if the amount is too large. If it is the latter, some extra steps are taken in this step.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">Layering</h2>
        <p>This step is optional if the amount is too small. Laying is moving the money around online and offline, to muddy the trail and to make it appear as legitmate income. This is done more or less depending on the amount being laundered.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">Integration</h2>
        <p>This is the final step. This is additional layering and usually transferring to offshore (usually Carribean) bank accounts, or other nessesary steps to making the money clean enough to withdraw and spend.</p>
